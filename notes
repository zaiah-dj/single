this render thing is too difficult...

RAW (no table key)
	memcpy

DIRECT
	get index of value

LOOP
	get index of table, how many values are there

STUB
	these don't change position, afaik, so maybe when getting
the first one, the others can be calculated by using the
loop's first index ( e.g. 'name' => the table, 'name.king'
=> the value, calculate the remaining positions of king by
multiplying the position by the current count

$KEY, $VALUE
	this one is a little easier... but needs some real
limitations, for example, do I allow any other stubs?


this SHOULD save some time when looping, since now just
references are needed


map should look like:
{ size, index, action & type (should be bitmasks), content }
(trim to four ?)

i don't have to use an array to store each index, I can
start from a point and use an countsize ( e.g. i += cs,
where cs is the distance to the next valid key )

also, if each marker is stored in its own pointer, moving
backwards should not be very difficult
