t -Added SQLITE3_PATH and SQLITE3_GLOBAL to the build.  Users should have been able to do this a long time ago...
t -Added some slightly better documentation.  Still lots to go on this....

	 -Added vendor/sqlite3.[ch] to the build.  Will remove from v/c later, b/c I am not adding anything to it nor taking away anything from it.

	 -Made some changes to format strings because they were compiling without hitches in clang.
	 -Added a couple of more tests.

	 -Render tests are NOT coming along super well.  I found some bugs, but more than that, I can't seem to get the table structures to work correctly...

	 -Finished add tab tests.  They work reliably and don't rely on parsing of any kind.  In fact, the macros that are defined to make long structures might work better than expected.

	 -Will finally start adding some tests.
	 -Harness should be completely finished now.
	 -Synced all other directories with this same work.
