* sql bugs
	works much better...
	- maybe write macros / oneshots should be macros...
	x write comparison part
	- handle errors better (some things should return an error, make sure they are)  
		t->error == t->statusExpected
	x remove function pointer and replace with one static function that handles types
	-	static int sq_add( sqlite3_stmt *stmt, int i, const SQWrite *w ): returns sqlite3_bind_* result...
		add another for mysql/postgres/etc...


* network
	how do I integrate SSL / TLS?


* rendering
	kind of broken, cuz I can't get into the hash tables...	


* there are bugs and other things, but this is most of the work... after those two problems are solved...


* need many more examples

	clean up JSON and design some parsers
	design a small stupid ass game
	make a sound player that gets triggered by keys
	internet works, but what to make?
