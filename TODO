* convert docs to markdown

* put this in some kind of bug tracking system

* if this file is being tracked, stop it	

* check most of the items here because stuff has probably been done...

* sql bugs
	works much better...
	- maybe write macros / oneshots should be macros...
	x write comparison part
	- handle errors better (some things should return an error, make sure they are)  
		t->error == t->statusExpected
	x remove function pointer and replace with one static function that handles types
	x	static int sq_add( sqlite3_stmt *stmt, int i, const SQWrite *w ): returns sqlite3_bind_* result...
		add another for mysql/postgres/etc...


* network
	how do I integrate SSL / TLS?
	SSL / TLS context can be passed in via userdata, just gotta look at how it's done...


* socket
	SOCKET_SERVER, SOCKET_CLIENT can be used as shortcodes to socket init

	
* CLEAN UP!!!!
	- lots of old sql functions, no longer needed, will cut at least 500 lines from the code base

* compile time crash when objects are not there
	look at the Linux source code for this...

* errors don't write everywhere yet
		(etc)->error = ERROR_CODE

* rendering
	kind of broken, cuz I can't get into the hash tables...
