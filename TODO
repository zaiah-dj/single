* sql bugs
	change sq_exec, sq_insert and sq_save to sq_ex or sq_base.  one function to do all sql evaluation.   
	SELECT - put all results in a table
	CREATE/INSERT/DELETE... - tell me what happened in a table
	
	- using while loop to break up big queries hasn't been tested (and would it even work?)
	- differentiate between SELECT and SAVEPOINT
	 OR  
	- run all queries the same way, and check if arguments need to be bound everytime, because that's probably the case
	- how exactly do I tell my function pointer what another row looks like?



* network
	how do I integrate SSL / TLS?
	

* there are bugs and other things, but this is most of the work... after those two problems are solved...
