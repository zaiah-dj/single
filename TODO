- tables need to get fixed
		
	that said, I don't think there is a "root" row (there should be, but I don't think it's there)

	at null, the pointer changes again, but the count goes up (when finalizing)


- the count being off is not critical, but it holds up rendering...
	and also holds up getting reverse implemented
