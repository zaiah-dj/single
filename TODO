* sql bugs
	works much better...
	- maybe write macros...	
	- oneshots should be macros...
	- write comparison part
	- handle errors better (some things should return an error, make sure they are)  


* network
	how do I integrate SSL / TLS?
	

* there are bugs and other things, but this is most of the work... after those two problems are solved...
