* sql bugs
	works much better...
	- maybe write macros / oneshots should be macros...
	- write comparison part
	- handle errors better (some things should return an error, make sure they are)  
	- remove function pointer and replace with one static function that handles types
		static int sq_add( sqlite3_stmt *stmt, int i, const SQWrite *w ): returns sqlite3_bind_* result...
		add another for mysql/postgres/etc...


* network
	how do I integrate SSL / TLS?
	

* there are bugs and other things, but this is most of the work... after those two problems are solved...
