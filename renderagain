render loop
assume a map that looks like this (can be more complicated)

start @ depth first
	this might have to be a linked list of arrays

	[ 0 ]
	[ 1 ]
	[ 2 ] -> 


keeping the pay as you go model
	always assume that the table is right and won't be changed
	
	1. copy raw
	2. deallocate that block, move pointer up, this is a linked list
	3. catch all blocks within the loop
			set pointer to block


moving to a recursive model
	ren_ren ( can run locally, not by the user )
	
	on loop
		get number of rows in the table
		then get count of columns
